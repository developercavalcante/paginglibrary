# Paging Library Demo

This is a sample repo to show how to use the Android Paging Library announced in the **Google I/O 2018**

This app uses **MVVM Architecture**. I have used following components for the development

* **View Model** - Manage your UI's data in life-cycle aware fasion
* **Retrofit2** - Manager your networking calls
* **Java8** - Added lambda support
* **Paging Library** - The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app's RecyclerView.
